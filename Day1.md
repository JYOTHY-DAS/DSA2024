Today, I attended the first class of the "Data Science and Analytics" course at ICT Academy in Thiruvananthapuram. Our instructor, Mr. Sajil CK, emphasized the importance of mastering touch typing for efficient coding and introduced us to the platform [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/) for practice. He also encouraged us to become familiar with Linux software, highlighting its command-line interface (CLI) as a powerful tool for task automation.

We explored Google Workspace apps, specifically Google Sheets and Google Slides. Mr. Sajil explained that Google Sheets is a robust alternative to Excel for basic data analysis, while Google Slides serves as a free presentation tool akin to PowerPoint.

Next, we discussed Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), comparing Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Google Colab:

### VS Code
**Advantages:**
- **Local Environment:** Offers full control and customization over your development setup.
-  **Powerful Features:** Includes advanced capabilities like debugging, code completion, and version control integration.
- **Extensive Extensions:** A vast library of extensions for various languages and frameworks.
-  **Offline Access:** Usable without an internet connection, ideal for limited connectivity.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Setup Overhead:** Requires initial configuration.
- **Resource Intensive:** Can consume significant resources, especially for large projects.

### Google Colab
**Advantages:**
 - **Cloud-Based:** No local setup needed, accessible from any device with internet.
 - **Free GPU and Kaggle Access:** Provides free access to GPUs for accelerated machine learning tasks and resources from Kaggle.
 - **Easy Sharing and Collaboration:** Notebooks can be effortlessly shared and collaborated on.
 - **Quick Experimentation:** Perfect for rapid prototyping.

**Disadvantages:**
 - **Internet Dependency:** Requires a stable internet connection, with potential for runtime disconnections.
 - **Limited Customization:** Less flexibility compared to a local environment.
 - **Storage Limitations:** Restricted storage space for data and projects.

### Choosing the Right Tool
The choice between VS Code and Google Colab depends on your specific needs:
  For serious development and large-scale projects, VS Code is preferred for its flexibility and customization.
  For quick experiments and sharing, Google Colab is ideal, especially for those without powerful local machines.

A hybrid approach can also be effective; develop code locally in VS Code, then leverage Google Colab for GPU-accelerated training or quick experiments.

### Profile Building
We also discussed the importance of profile building, particularly through GitHub. Mr. Sajil stressed that GitHub is essential for showcasing code and projects. GitHub's version control allows us to:
 - **Track Changes:** Monitor who made specific updates and when.
 - **Revert Versions:** Undo mistakes or explore different approaches.
 - **Collaborate Effectively:** Work with others seamlessly on shared projects.
 - **Manage Complexity:** Break down large projects into manageable segments.
He encouraged us to include more projects on GitHub and to use comprehensive 'README.md' files to explain them. We learned about Markdown, a text-based formatting language, ideal for creating these documentation files.

Additionally, he introduced us to Overleaf, a tool for crafting LaTeX-formatted resumes. We also learned about creating professional websites to showcase our work using [Themewagon](https://themewagon.com/), which offers user-friendly templates. An example of a well-structured site is [colah.github.io](https://colah.github.io).

As a final tip, Mr. Sajil advised us to incorporate keywords relevant to our field in our resumes. By customizing our resumes according to job descriptions, we can better navigate the filtering systems used by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
